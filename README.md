# Swisseph Jyotiṣa

In Sanskrit, the word Jyotiṣa, translated as "science of light", refers to the profound and mathematically sophisticated form of astrology originating in the ancient Vedic traditions of India.

Sometimes known as Vedic astrology, Jyotiṣa describes the planetary patterns at the time of our birth and can give us valuable clues to understanding our life's journey.

Through careful analysis of these cosmic influences, Jyotiṣa can help us to realistically evaluate our strengths and challenges in order to optimize our full potential.

By forecasting the changing trends and periods of our lives, Jyotiṣa can also enable us to make more evolutionary choices.

It offers practical remedial measures to alleviate areas of difficulty, giving us the confidence to manifest our true destiny and create success, happiness, and harmony on all levels.
